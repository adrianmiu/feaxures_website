<h3>Advantages of using Feaxures for progressive enhancement</h3>
<hr/>

* <strong>Responsive friendly</strong> -  If you ever made a 100% responsive website, with Feaxures you can reach 125%. At least.
* <strong>Network speed friendly</strong> -  Only 3kb minified and gziped, without your loader of choice (<a href="http://www.requirejs.org">RequireJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cujojs/curlâ€Ž">curljs</a> or even <a href="http://yepnopejs.com/">yepnope</a>)
* <strong>Google friendly</strong> -  By loading your JS/CSS async and in paralel your website will appear faster to Google.
* <strong>No-jQuery friendly</strong> -  I've heard some apocaliptic prophecies, so I've decide to prepare for the catastrophic event of jQuery's death
* <strong>IE friendly</strong> -  Not really a selling point for devs, but for managers. And only if they care for users. :)
* <strong>Simple API</strong> -  If you know how to write HTML and JSON you're good to go. Take a look at the <a href="/examples">examples</a>
* <strong>Tested</strong> -  Code coverage reports coming soon.
